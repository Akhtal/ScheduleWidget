ScheduleWidget is a .NET 4.x scheduling engine that handles recurring events 
for calendars. It is powerful, easy, and free. My contact info:

The project page is here: http://www.squarewidget.com/schedulewidget

It is available as a nuget package and open source is at github here:
https://github.com/jamesstill/ScheduleWidget 

This sample project was created to show a fully-functional web application
in which ScheduleWidget is used to create and display event occurrences on
a javascript calendar control. As the tool becomes more popular I've had 
several devs contacting me with similar questions. The tutorials I put up
on my blog address little recipes here and there but I can tell we need a
full project to illustrate the workflow.

Enjoy!
